# 📊 Marketing Campaign Performance Analysis

## 📌 Context  
Companies invest thousands of dollars in marketing campaigns, but not all of them achieve the expected results. That’s why analyzing performance is crucial to allocate budgets wisely and improve ROI.  

For this project, I worked with a dataset of **1,200 marketing campaigns** containing information such as:  
- Campaign channel (Email, Social Media, TV, Radio, SEO, Google Ads, Influencers)  
- Budget, Impressions, Clicks, Conversions, Revenue  
- Start and End dates  

The goal was to **identify the most profitable channels, detect inefficient campaigns, and provide actionable recommendations.**

## 📊 Key Visualizations  

1. **Average ROI by Marketing Channel**  
   👉 Social Media, Radio, and SEO stand out with the **highest ROI**, showing they deliver strong returns compared to other channels like TV or Google Ads.  

2. **Revenue vs. Budget by Channel**  
   👉 Although channels like TV and Google Ads require higher budgets, their returns are not as efficient as Social Media or SEO.  

3. **Top 10 Campaigns by ROI**  
   👉 Specific campaigns achieved outstanding ROI, showing that well-executed strategies can outperform even with moderate budgets.  

4. **High-Budget, Low-Performance Campaigns**  
   👉 Some campaigns consumed large budgets but generated poor results, signaling the need for review and optimization.  

5. **Budget vs. Conversions (Scatter Plot)**  
   👉 The relationship between budget and conversions is not strictly linear.  
   - Some campaigns achieved high conversions with relatively low budgets (high efficiency).  
   - Others spent heavily but converted very little, showing inefficiency.  
   - This suggests that **strategy and execution matter as much as budget allocation.**

## 🔎 Main Findings  
- **Social Media, Radio, and SEO** are the channels with the **highest returns**.  
- Increasing budget does not always guarantee higher conversions.  
- There are **efficient low-budget campaigns** worth replicating or using as inspiration.  
- Some **high-budget campaigns underperformed**, highlighting opportunities to reallocate funds.  

---

## 💡 Recommendations  
- **Invest more in Social Media and SEO**, as they consistently bring strong returns.  
- **Review high-performing campaigns** to understand what worked and replicate key elements (without copying them entirely, as results on social media depend on creativity and timing).  
- **Audit inefficient campaigns** with high budget but low ROI to identify gaps (targeting, message, or channel selection).  
- **Optimize before scaling**: rather than simply increasing budgets, focus on segmentation, creativity, and channel mix to maximize results.

## ✅ Conclusion  
Data-driven analysis is essential to maximize ROI in marketing. This project demonstrates how visual insights from **Power BI** can guide smarter decisions, ensuring that every dollar spent on marketing generates real impact.
